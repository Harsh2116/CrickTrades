    <h1>How CrickTrades Works</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stock Price Movement:</strong> The price of stocks on CrickTrades changes dynamically based on market demand and supply. When more users buy a stock, its price tends to increase, and when more users sell, the price decreases. Real-time updates are provided via WebSocket to keep the market data live.</li>
        <li><strong>Joining Contests:</strong> Users can join contests by paying the entry fee from their wallet balance. Contests have start and end times, and users can participate in multiple contests. Winning prizes are distributed based on user performance and leaderboard rankings.</li>
        <li><strong>Wallet System:</strong> The wallet securely manages user funds, including main balance, referral bonuses, and stock buying balance. Users can add money, join contests, and withdraw winnings through the wallet.</li>
        <li><strong>Referral Program:</strong> Users can refer friends to CrickTrades using their unique referral code. When referred users add money to their wallet, the referrer earns a bonus reward credited to their wallet.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Market Data:</strong> CrickTrades provides live updates on stock prices and volumes, enabling users to make informed decisions while buying or selling stocks.</li>
        <li><strong>Contests and Prizes:</strong> Contests offer exciting opportunities to win prizes. The prize pool is displayed on the contest page, and winning prizes are distributed among top performers based on their portfolio profits.</li>
        <li><strong>User Portfolio:</strong> Users can build and manage their stock portfolio by buying and selling stocks. Portfolio performance is tracked in real-time with profit/loss calculations.</li>
        <li><strong>Security and Authentication:</strong> User accounts are secured with authentication tokens. Sensitive operations require valid login sessions to ensure data privacy and security.</li>
        <li><strong>KYC Compliance:</strong> Users are required to complete KYC (Know Your Customer) verification to comply with regulatory requirements and enable withdrawals.</li>
        <li><strong>Support and Feedback:</strong> CrickTrades values user feedback and provides support channels to assist with any issues or questions.</li>
